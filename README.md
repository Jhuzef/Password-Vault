# Password-Vault
A perl script that stores your log-in credentials by storing it into a seperate text file. 
It utulizies regular experessions to parse the created text file, 'vault.'
It is a script to help user keep track of their log-in credentials, however I advise you keep very private passwords off this script.
This script offers a good alternative to storing passwords than just writing it into a notepad and saving it.
It also does a decent job at keeping people who are unfamiliar with changing file permissions away from the text file.

Instructions:
The script will run you through all the necessities. Keep in mind that every user needs to create an admin username and password.
So essentially, you can have multiple people use this script and keep all their personal passwords seperate.
